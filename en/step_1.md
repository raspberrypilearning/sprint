## Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to create a running game with a 3D perspective. Players will repeatedly press the left and right arrow keys to run 100 meters as quickly as they can.

## Resources
For this project, Scratch 2 should be used. Scratch 2 can either be used online at [jumpto.cc/scratch-on](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-on) or can be downloaded from [jumpto.cc/scratch-off](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-off) and used offline.

The 'Project Materials' link for this project contains the following resources:

##### Club leader Resources

You can find a completed version of this project <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/85609372/#editor">online</a>, or it can be downloaded by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

+ Sprint.sb2

##### Project Resources

For this project, club members can make use of a Scratch project containing the required resources. This project is available at [jumpto.cc/sprint-resources](http://jumpto.cc/sprint-resources), or it can be downloaded by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

+ SprintResources.sb2

Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources.

## Learning Objectives
+ Repetition (the `repeat until`{:class="blockcontrol"} block).

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)

## Challenges
+ "Add a spectator" - Create a spectator that moves towards the player until they've sprinted 100 meters.
